Here’s a ready-to-go prompt you can share with students to paste into Perplexity-Pro:

“I need to build an Android app that scrapes notifications, circulars, updates, and amendments from India’s Income-Tax and GST department websites and pushes them to users via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

List every Android SDK, Java/Kotlin library, Gradle plugin, Python/Node.js package, and CLI tool required to:

Fetch and parse HTML (e.g. Jsoup, Cheerio)

Handle authentication or CAPTCHA on government sites

Schedule background scraping jobs reliably (e.g. WorkManager, cron)

Send FCM push notifications

Bundle everything into a single APK

Include exact Maven/Gradle artifact coordinates or npm package names.

Group prerequisites by frontend (Android) vs. backend (Cloud Functions) vs. CLI tools.”
